# Prompts for Copilot/ChatGPT/similar LLMs used in the creation of this app

For the next part of this project, I want to take JSON in the given form and show the trivia questions and make the user answer them, which means completing the layout for the game. Then when the correct format of JSON shows up in the messages, display the game.

Can you help write tests for our new components?
